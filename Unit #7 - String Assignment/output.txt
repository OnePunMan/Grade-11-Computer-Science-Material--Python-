Hi  my  name  is Jackie. I am awesome. It took me a while to 
figure  out  exactly  how  to  read text from files. After a 
while  of  struggling,  I  finally  realized  why everything 
didn't  work  at  first,  I  forgot  to  put  in "self" as a 
parameter  in my method, how silly. After getting the method 
to  work,  I began to write this long and useless note about 
my strings, and I think I am going to stop now.
